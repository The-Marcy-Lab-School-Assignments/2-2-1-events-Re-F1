# Question
What is Event Driven Architecture?

# Answer

An `Event Driven Architecture` is 
        
         - the service will send the event after it has happened.
         - If the state in your application is changed, then an event is raised (submit, or logging into account) 
         - There is usually not any instrucitons.
         - The way they are handled are immutable, can not be changed, can not
         be deleted, and are a pernament record of what is happening in the app

## Is used best when :
a process can be run seperately and does not a direct consequence on the application raising the events
is really useful for auditing : where you need to examine every single action that the user does, but the application does not need to know about it

backend processes, sending an email after someones order something (it does not need to be immediate)

very good for data processing, if you got alot of info coming in from your applciation, and you wanna feed that into another system then you wanna use event driven architecture

### 3 main components
The **produce** : which publishes the events

the **broker** : which subscribers get which events

the **consumer** : which subscribes to the event brokers to recieve the events

## Advantages over the API driven model
 - Decouples the components
   * As the publisher, does not need to know what the subscriber is doing
    Service 2 can go offline and can pick up where it ended at. Service 1 is no affected
 - Dependency aversion

## Disadvanatges using 
- data consistency
 - duplicate messages
