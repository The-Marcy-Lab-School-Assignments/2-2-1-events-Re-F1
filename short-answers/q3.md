# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation allows to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will match a selector, whether the tags exist or will be added.

Example Used:
lets say that whenever you click on a button, you want the text content to appear in the console log.


Like so :
```css
<div>
<button>Button1</button>
<button>Button2</button> 
<button>Button3</button>
</div>
```
**Individual Event Listeners :**
```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
buttons. forEach( (button) => {
button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
console. log (event.target.innerText)
})
})
```

**With Event Delegation :**
```js
const div = document. querySelector ('div')
div.addEventListener( 'click', event =>
const target = event. target
if (target. tagName === 'BUTTON ') {
console. log (target. innerText)
})
```
        If i want to add another button, I won't need to change the code in my js file as the 
    
        Using event delegation, the buttons are dynamically added or removed from the DOM.
and to minimize the number of event listeners
