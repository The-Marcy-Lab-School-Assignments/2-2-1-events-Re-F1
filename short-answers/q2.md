# Question
What is event delegation?

# Answer
Event Delegation is an event handling pattern where you handle events at a higher level in the DOM tree instead of the actual level where the event was. Useful pattern that allows you to write cleaner code and create lesser event listners for similar logic (shorting the code and making it less repeative when using even listeners - in js)
